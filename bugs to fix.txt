Splitscreen works now but there are some key bugs 
for example
1) When you have sucessfully splitted the screen the user can not perform 
any actions a regular tab has 
(he can not save , he can not open file, he can not use keybinds ) 
2) the split does not include already existing tabs if the user checks the box to include them 
3) the splitted tabs work as one you can not close for example one window when you have 
a two way splited screen you can only close everything at once 
4) there is no global Ui changes becausw i have done some spageti code and the widgets such as number line and minimap
do not change theme when you change theme through the theme manager.
5) The theme changes of the user from theme manager do not save after quiting the app
