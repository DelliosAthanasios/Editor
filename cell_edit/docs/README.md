## Plugin Development Guide

The Cell Editor v2 is designed to be highly extensible through its robust plugin system. This guide outlines how to develop and integrate your own plugins to extend the editor's functionality.

### Plugin Structure

A plugin is typically a Python package or module that implements one or more of the defined extension points. A basic plugin structure might look like this:

```
my_awesome_plugin/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py             # Main plugin logic, registers with extension points
├── functions.py        # Custom formula functions
├── ui_elements.py      # Custom UI components
└── config.py           # Plugin-specific configuration
```

### Extension Points

Plugins interact with the Cell Editor through well-defined **Extension Points** (defined in `core/interfaces.py` and `plugins/extension_points.py`). These are abstract interfaces that your plugin classes should implement.

Key extension points include:

-   **`IFunctionPlugin`**: For registering custom functions that can be used in cell formulas.
-   **`IDataTypePlugin`**: For defining and registering new data types.
-   **`IUIPlugin`**: For extending the user interface with new widgets, menu items, or toolbar buttons.
-   **`IIOPlugin`**: For adding support for new import/export file formats.
-   **`IThemePlugin`**: For providing custom themes and styling.

### Hook System

The **Hook System** (`plugins/hook_system.py`) allows plugins to execute code at specific points in the application's lifecycle or in response to certain events. Plugins can `register` functions to be called when a hook is `triggered`.

Example:

```python
# In your plugin's main.py
from cell_editor_v2.plugins.hook_system import get_hook_system
from cell_editor_v2.core.events import EventType

def on_cell_value_changed(event):
    print(f"Plugin detected cell change: {event.sheet_name}!{event.coordinate.to_a1()} changed to {event.new_value}")

class MyAwesomePlugin:
    def activate(self):
        hook_system = get_hook_system()
        hook_system.register_hook(EventType.CELL_VALUE_CHANGED, on_cell_value_changed)
        print("MyAwesomePlugin activated!")

    def deactivate(self):
        hook_system = get_hook_system()
        hook_system.unregister_hook(EventType.CELL_VALUE_CHANGED, on_cell_value_changed)
        print("MyAwesomePlugin deactivated!")

# The plugin manager will call activate/deactivate methods
```

### Registering Custom Functions

To add a custom function, your plugin should implement `IFunctionPlugin` and return your functions in the `get_functions` method:

```python
# In my_awesome_plugin/functions.py
from cell_editor_v2.plugins.extension_points import IFunctionPlugin

class MyCustomFunctions(IFunctionPlugin):
    def get_functions(self):
        return {
            "MYADD": self._my_add_function,
            "MYMULTIPLY": self._my_multiply_function,
        }

    def _my_add_function(self, *args):
        # Example: Simple sum of arguments
        return sum(args)

    def _my_multiply_function(self, *args):
        # Example: Product of arguments
        result = 1
        for arg in args:
            result *= arg
        return result

# In my_awesome_plugin/main.py
from .functions import MyCustomFunctions

class MyAwesomePlugin:
    def activate(self):
        # ... other activations ...
        from cell_editor_v2.plugins.function_extensions import get_function_extension_manager
        get_function_extension_manager().register_function_plugin(MyCustomFunctions())
        print("Custom functions registered!")

    def deactivate(self):
        # ... other deactivations ...
        from cell_editor_v2.plugins.function_extensions import get_function_extension_manager
        get_function_extension_manager().unregister_function_plugin(MyCustomFunctions())
        print("Custom functions unregistered!")
```

Users can then use `=MYADD(A1, B1)` in their cells.

### Plugin Discovery and Loading

Plugins are typically placed in a designated `plugins/` directory within the application or a user-defined plugin path. The `PluginManager` (`plugins/plugin_manager.py`) scans these directories, discovers plugins, and manages their lifecycle.

To load your plugin, ensure it's in a discoverable location and the `PluginManager` is initialized and activated.

### Best Practices for Plugin Development

-   **Modularity**: Keep your plugin focused on a single concern.
-   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling within your plugin to prevent it from crashing the main application.
-   **Performance**: Be mindful of performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or frequent operations. Utilize the editor's core components (e.g., `SparseMatrix`, `FormulaEngine`) for efficiency.
-   **Documentation**: Document your plugin's functionality, usage, and any dependencies.
-   **Testing**: Thoroughly test your plugin, especially its interactions with the core application and other plugins.

This guide provides a starting point. Refer to the source code of `plugins/` module for detailed interfaces and examples.




## Performance Optimization Techniques

The Cell Editor v2 is engineered for high performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Several optimization techniques are employed across different modules:

### 1. Memory Efficiency

-   **Sparse Matrix Storage**: Instead of storing every cell in a dense grid, the `storage/sparse_matrix.py` only stores non-empty cells. This drastically reduces memory consumption for typical spreadsheets which are often sparse.
-   **Lazy Loading**: The `storage/lazy_loader.py` ensures that cell data is loaded into memory only when it's accessed or becomes visible in the viewport. This prevents loading the entire dataset into RAM, making it possible to work with millions of cells.
-   **Object Pooling**: (Conceptual, can be implemented in `core/memory_pool.py`) Reusing objects instead of constantly creating and destroying them reduces garbage collection overhead and memory fragmentation.
-   **Data Compression**: The `persistence/compression_manager.py` and `storage/compression.py` can apply various compression algorithms (e.g., ZLIB, LZMA) to cell data, both in memory and when saved to disk, further reducing memory footprint and file size.

### 2. High-Performance Calculations

-   **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Parsing**: Formulas are parsed into ASTs (`formula/ast_parser.py`), which are more efficient to evaluate than raw strings.
-   **Dependency Graph & Incremental Recalculation**: The `formula/dependency_graph.py` tracks cell dependencies. When a cell changes, only dependent cells are re-evaluated, not the entire sheet. This incremental recalculation is key for responsiveness.
-   **Formula Optimization**: The `formula/optimizer.py` applies techniques like constant folding (evaluating constant parts of a formula once) and algebraic simplification to reduce the computational load of formulas.
-   **Caching**: Results of expensive calculations (e.g., formula evaluations, rendered cell properties) are cached to avoid redundant computations.
-   **Batch Processing**: Operations that can be parallelized or are more efficient when processed in groups (e.g., applying a transformation to a range of cells) are handled in batches (`performance/optimization_tools.py`).
-   **Potential for JIT Compilation & C Extensions**: The architecture allows for integration of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers (e.g., Numba) or performance-critical sections written in C/C++ (`performance/optimization_tools.py`) for further speedups.

### 3. Responsive User Interface

-   **Virtual Scrolling**: The `ui/virtual_scroller.py` and `ui/viewport.py` ensure that only the cells currently visible in the user's viewport are rendered. This prevents the UI from becoming sluggish when dealing with large sheets.
-   **Efficient Cell Rendering**: The `ui/cell_renderer.py` is optimized to draw cells quickly, minimizing redraw times and maintaining a high Frames Per Second (FPS) for a smooth user experience.
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: Potentially long-running tasks (e.g., complex calculations, file I/O) can be offloaded to background threads to keep the UI responsive.

### 4. Efficient Persistence

-   **Binary File Format**: A custom binary file format (`persistence/file_format.py`) is used instead of text-based formats (like CSV or JSON) for faster read/write operations and smaller file sizes.
-   **Incremental Saving**: The `persistence/incremental_saver.py` saves only the changes made since the last save, significantly reducing the time and resources required for frequent saves.
-   **Optimized I/O**: File operations are designed to minimize disk access and leverage efficient buffering techniques.

### 5. Monitoring and Profiling

-   **Performance Monitoring**: The `performance/monitoring.py` module provides real-time metrics (CPU, memory, FPS, event rates) to identify performance bottlenecks as they occur.
-   **Profiling Tools**: Integrated memory and CPU profilers (`performance/profiling.py`) help developers pinpoint exact lines of code causing performance issues.
-   **Stress Testing**: The `performance/stress_testing.py` module allows for simulating extreme workloads to validate the application's performance and stability under pressure.

By combining these techniques, the Cell Editor v2 aims to deliver a high-performance, scalable, and responsive user experience, even when handling datasets with millions of cells. Developers can leverage the provided tools to continuously monitor and optimize the application's performance.
