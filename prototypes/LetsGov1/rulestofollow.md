Here I will list the principles of the application 
always bare in bind the principles 
1) The app should be completly navigatable through only the keyboard (of course the user can use the mouse but only keyboard navigation is suggested)
2) Everything has a keybind 
3) Everything will be initiated and shown to the user through the canvas / The canvas will be 
the area were the UI will be shown and initiated however it will be very easy to support new
UI elemets and scripts :
In canvas : 
Every window will be resisable 
It can support showing multiple scripts
it will be lightweight and error free (as much as we can at least)
The whole idea 
The canvas will be exactly like a paint canvas 
where the programmer *painter* (me) can add lots of other features and apps in the future 
and can be integrated easily. For now we will code the editor instanses on the canvas and the splitscreen functionality of the editor
4) it will support all kinds of UI elements from programming languages and operatinf systems (We will do it in the future)
5) The app will be straightforward for beginners not like Emacs which throughs you in the see 
6) Modularity is key every keybind / logic / color theme /etc should me modular 
7) The editor should be completly reprogrammable because of its modular for make it easy for programmers to make changes
8) The app should be a strong foundation for future expansions like a deticated Excel style app (or something even more ambitious)
9) Simplicity is needed / Complex system derive from simple ones
