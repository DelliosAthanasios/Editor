/* Every action in the editor will be also mapped to a keybinding
here. The app will be completly customizable and the user will be able to
change the keybindings to their liking. The keybindings will be stored in a
file and loaded at startup. The user will be able to reset the keybindings
to default or save their own keybindings. The keybindings will be used to
perform actions in the editor like opening files, saving files, undoing,
redoing, cutting, copying, pasting, selecting all, searching, replacing,
and more. The keybindings will be used in conjunction with the menu and
toolbar to provide a complete and customizable user experience.
I repeat every actrion in the editor will be mapped to a keybinding.
