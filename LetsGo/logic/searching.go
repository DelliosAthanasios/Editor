/*
Here will be the logic of the searching functionality in the application.
We will implement a search function that allows users to fin text within the current file.
The search function will take
1) a search term as input
2) search through the text of the current file ( Let the user deside which algorithm to use, like linear search or regexm or binary search by default use the faster one)
3) Highlite the found text in the file
4) if the user allows it add a replace function that will replace the found text with a new text
5) The user can replace all or just one instance of the found text
6) The user can navigate through the found instances of the text
7) The user can cancel the search operation at any time
8) The search function will be case sensitive or insensitive based on user preference
9) The search function will support regular expressions for advanced searching
