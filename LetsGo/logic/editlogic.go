/* Here add the main logic of the application
let me list it for you:
New File = Creates a new file
Open file = Opens an existing file
Save File = Saves the current file
Duplicate File = Duplicates the current file
Save all = Saves all open files
Close File = Closes the current file
Edit File = Edits the current file
Delete File = Deletes the current file
*/
/*
Then we have text manipulation functions:
 undo = Undoes the last action
 redo = Redoes the last undone action
 Select All = Selects all text in the current file
 Go to Start of a line = Moves the cursor to the start of the current line
 Go to End of a line = Moves the cursor to the end of the current line
 Go to Start of a file = Moves the cursor to the start of the file
 Go to End of a file = Moves the cursor to the end of the file
 go to Next word = Moves the cursor to the next word
 go to Previous word = Moves the cursor to the previous word
 delete word = Deletes the word at the cursor position
 delete line = Deletes the current line
 go forward one character = Moves the cursor one character forward
 go backward one character = Moves the cursor one character backward
 go to next line = Moves the cursor to the next line
 go to previous line = Moves the cursor to the previous line
*/
/*
 we will continue with more text manipulation functions in the future
*/
