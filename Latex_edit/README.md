# LaTeX Editor Environment

A modern LaTeX editing environment for Third Edit, inspired by TeXstudio, with:

- **Compiler detection**: Finds pdflatex/xelatex/lualatex on startup.
- **Styled UI**: Matches the main editor's look and feel.
- **Run/Stop buttons**: Compile and stop LaTeX jobs.
- **Output panel**: Shows compiler output and errors.
- **Syntax highlighting**: For LaTeX commands, comments, math, and braces.
- **Next word suggestions**: Suggests LaTeX commands as you type.
- **Extensible**: Add more features from TeXstudio as needed.
- **Integrates with main editor features**: Keybinds, dynamic saving, search, minimap, numberline, etc.

## Usage

Import and add `LatexEditorEnv` as a widget in your main window or as a new tab.

## TODO
- Integrate with main editor's keybinds, minimap, numberline, and dynamic saving.
- Add more TeXstudio-like features (structure view, symbol panel, etc).
- Improve word suggestion UI (popup/autocomplete).
